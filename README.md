This switch activity app is built for teachers and therapists who need to track the progress of their students/clients who use assistive switches. Users can create a custom activity, complete the activity in real-time and save the results for easy sharing and reviewing. The dashboard displays progress over time and can be used for parent/teacher meetings, IEP planning & goal tracking, and device trial data collection.
